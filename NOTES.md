CLI GEM PROJECT 


AmazonCLI will be a command-line app to allow a user to see a 
list of the 'Kindle Select 25' when they run the app.

When they run the app, they will see a greeting, a list of upcoming
titles, and be asked to enter a number corresponding to a prompt. 

Available prompts will look something like this:

Select a title for more details:

1.	Book 1
2.	Book 2
3.	Book 3
â€¦etc.
4.	Exit

After making a selection the user will see the book title, author, genre, and price

The user will not be able to make any creations or edits to any of the lists.

AmazonScraper will scrape the site and create the books, and 
AmazonCLI will interact with the user.
