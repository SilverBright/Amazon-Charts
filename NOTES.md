CLI GEM PROJECT 


AmazonCLI will be a command-line app to allow a user to see a list of the 'Top 20 Most Sold & Most Read Books of the Week' in Fiction and non-Fiction, when they run the app.

When they run the app, they will see a greeting, and be asked to enter a number corresponding to a prompt. 

Available prompts will look something like this:

Select if you'd like to see the top 20 books in Fiction or non-fiction for the week:

1.	Top Books in Fiction
2.	Top Books in non-Fiction
3.	Exit

After making a selection the user will see the book title, author, publisher.

The user will not be able to make any creations or edits to any of the lists.

Scraper will scrape the site and create the books, and AmazonCLI will interact with the user.

What is a book?
		
	A book has a title
