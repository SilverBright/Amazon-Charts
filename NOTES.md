CLI GEM PROJECT 


AmazonCLI will be a command-line app to allow a user to see a 
list of the 'Top 20 Most Sold & Most Read Books of the Week' when they run the app.

When they run the app, they will see a greeting, a list of 
titles, and be asked to enter a number corresponding to a prompt. 

Available prompts will look something like this:

Select a title for more details:

1.	Book 1
2.	Book 2
3.	Book 3
â€¦etc.
4.	Exit

After making a selection the user will see the book title, author, publisher, rating, and ranking.

The user will not be able to make any creations or edits to any of the lists.

Scraper will scrape the site and create the books, and AmazonCLI will interact with the user.
